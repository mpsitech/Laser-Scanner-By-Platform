Purpose
=======

This documentation covers the platform-specific aspects of the Whiznium StarterKit.
The Whiznium StarterKit is a tabletop 3D laser scanner which in turn serves as a comprehensive example for the power of model-based source code generation by means of the Open Source Whiznium developer tools.

While this documentation is closely related to the corresponding (Linux) host code, to be found here:

`Whiznium StarterKit on GitHub <https://github.com/mpsitech/wzsk-Whiznium-StarterKit>`_

... and to the VHDL/C device code, to be found here:

`Whiznium StarterKit Device on GitHub <https://github.com/mpsitech/wskd-Whiznium-StarterKit-Device>`_

... here you will find everything from adapter PCB schematics and board files, to vendor IDE bring-up instructions, to referred vendor IP documentation (such as application notes and datasheets).
